# Zero-Shot Seafloor Sediment Microtopography Characterization Using Stereo from a Drifting Monocular Camera
[View PDF](docs/ACIVS_2025_Sediment_Microtopography.pdf)

High-resolution characterization of seafloor sediment microtopography is essential for understanding benthic habitat structure, sedimentary processes, and ecological function. However, existing methods typically rely on core-based sampling or specialized 3D imaging systems, both of which are limited by cost, complexity, and scalability. In this study, we present a cost-effective, camera-based framework for quantitative sediment surface analysis using video footage from a drifting monocular underwater camera. The method leverages a zero-shot application of [RAFT-Stereo](https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT-Stereo) to estimate dense disparity maps from sequential frames without requiring prior training on sediment data. After normalizing disparities, we apply surface detrending and extract statistical and morphological roughness features. Through a small-scale case study, we evaluate the method on two distinct sediment types, Sand and Shell-Hash, and demonstrate that the extracted features effectively capture surface complexity. Additionally, we assess the pipelineâ€™s consistency using overlapping samples acquired with different virtual stereo baselines, showing that key global features remain robust despite variations in camera motion. This framework offers a scalable, non-invasive solution for retrospective and in-situ sediment analysis in marine monitoring.

The pipeline comprises six main components: camera calibration, data acquisition, distortion removal, preprocessing, depth estimation, and microtopography feature extraction.

## Usage 
### Preparation 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahrokh1106/sediment-microtopography-monocamera.git
cd sediment-microtopography-monocamera
python -m venv sediment_env
sediment_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Raft-Stereo needs Pytorch. Depending on the GPU capability of your system, you can install it from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

### Run
Run *test.py* to get the microtopography features from a pair of sequential frames as an example. The results will be saved in the "example" folder

Run *experiments.py* to get the same results in the paper from two sediment types. The results will be saved in the "dataset" folder
