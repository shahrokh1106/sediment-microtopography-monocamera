# Sediment microtopography analysis based on depth estimation from a single moving drop camera

* Dataset: Seabed videos from the subtidal environment around Little Barrier Island
* Calibrating their drop camera
* Feature-based rectification and disparity map computation
* Depth map estimation and 3D-reconstruction from rectified video frames
* Micro-topography characteristic analysis based on depth maps and surface reconstruction
